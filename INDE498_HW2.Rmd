# Chapter 2, Exercise 3
Pick up any dataset you have used, and randomly split the data into two halves. Use one half to build the tree model and the regression model. Test the models’ prediction performances on the second half. Report what you have found, adjust your way of model building, and suggest a strategy to find the model you consider as the best.
  
# Chapter 2, Exercise 4 
Consider the case that, in building linear regression models, there is a concern that some data points may be more important (or more trustable). Thus, it is not uncommon to assign a weight to each data point. Denote the weight for the ith data point as w_i. We still want to estimate the regression parameters in the least squares framework. Follow the process of the derivation of the least squares estimator and propose your new estimator of the regression parameters.




# Chapter 3, Exercise 1
Create a new binary variable based on AGE, by labeling the subjects whose age is above the mean of AGE to be class “1” and labeling the subjects whose age is below the mean of AGE to be class “0”. Then, repeat the analysis shown in the R lab of this chapter for the logistic regression model and the analysis shown in the R lab of Chapter 2 for decision tree model. Identify the final models you would select, evaluate the models, and compare the regression model with the tree model.

# Chapter 3, Exercise 2
Find two datasets from the UCI data repository or R datasets. Conduct a detailed analysis for both datasets using both logistic regression model and the tree model, e.g., for regression model, you may want to conduct model selection, model comparison, testing of the significance of the regression parameters, evaluation of the R-squared and significance of the model. Also comment on the application of your model on the context of the dataset you have selected.
